<h1>The Best Movies According to Franklin</h1>
    <h2>My top 5 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Both Parts) </h3>
<p>This is an amazing movie. Really shows what happened in the book.</p>
<h3>The Wandering Earth 2 </h3>
<p>Great sci-fi movie! Really realistic and shows many environmental issues (although it is a bit hard to understand)</p>
<h3>The Martian </h3>
<p>Another great sci-fi! This really shows what would happen if an astronaut got stuck on Mars. Great visual to the book!
</p>
<h3>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child (Play)</h3>
<p>This is an amazing sequel to the Harry Potter series. Really  nice! Illustrates time travel too!
</p>
<h3>Transformers </h3>
<p>This is the best of all in my opinion. The adventure is really suspensful.</p>
